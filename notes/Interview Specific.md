## Introduction

## Tell me a bit about yourself

Hi, my name is Shadab Zafar. 

I'm a masters student here at IIT Delhi - currently working on a project focussed on improving PoW blockchains (under Prof. Vinay Rebeiro.)

I did my bachelors from Jamia Millia, where for three summers in a row, I got selected for an international internship sponsored by Google - so Google paid me to contribute to open source organizations. 

Before joining the M.Tech program here, I worked at Adobe Systems as a Quality Engineer.

<!-- After B. Tech I worked at Adobe Systems for 3 months as a Quality Engineer, but later ended up dropping to focus on preparing for GATE - which is how I got here. -->

Outside of work, I like to spend my free time programming as well - either writing small tools for myself, or contributing to other open source projects.

<!-- I also have an interst in web security, so I've spent time in the past reverse engineering web APIs of various startups.  -->

<!-- I've also recently started jogging - following the C25K program, and am really enjoying it. -->
