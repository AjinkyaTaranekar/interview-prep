# Doubts

* Difference between check if tree is Heap / BST

* How to implement select, rank, size in BST? Store size field.

* Is dijkstra "greedy" or "dynamic programming"? 
    - Both!

* Study when advanced data structures are needed? Segment, Suffix, Range, KD etc.

* Problems with Optimal Substructure but NOT Overlapping Subproblems and vice versa?

* Look at basic bruteforce analysis
    - Think hard on whether Bruteforce will really fail or not
    - Multiple BFS on nearest clone isn't actually O(N^2)

* BFS always requires a distance array (per node)
    - Is there a good enough reason for not having it?

* Practice writing a few questions from scratch so you have some practice on quickly reading test cases etc.

* Look at Harish's optimised code for reading input

* DP: Ensure base cases follow the main recursive case too! 

## Dikkatein

* Dealing with python 1 based indexing, 0 based indexing

* What if given input ranges are 1 based
    - Converting it to 0-based that always works?
