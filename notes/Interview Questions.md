> Tell me a bit about yourself

<!-- 
    
My name is Shadab Zafar.

I have a huge penchant for writing code and have been doing it in some form or the other since my 10th class boards ended -- that's 2009.

~~I started with writing Batch Scripts but have come a long way from then.~~

I've come a long way from then in terms of the quality of code that I write and projects that I work on.

I've been doing a lot of Python based web dev projects lately, for example both of my GSoC projects included working with Flask based web applications.

I really believe in the power of automation and like writing small tools that smooth out my workflow for example I wrote a utility that uses a movie API to help me decide what movie to watch.

This friday, I developed a resume portal, in PHP, from scratch, and deployed it by the evening on a personal server. That is how those resumes reached you.

~~I can also fix merge conflicts in my sleep.~~
