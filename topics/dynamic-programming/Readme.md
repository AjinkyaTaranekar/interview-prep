## Problems

* Coin Changing

    - Minimum no. of coins
    
    - Total no. of ways
        + `{1, 2}` & `{2, 1}` are same
        + Are different
    
    - Doubts
        + When will greedy work or not?
        + What if we didn't have infinite supply of coins?

* Longest Increasing Subsequence

    - Monotonically Increasing, Decreasing
    - Non Decreasing etc.

    - ? - Increasing then Decreasing - **Bitonic**

    - DP Solution in O(n^2)

    - ? - Another one in O(n log n)
    
    - Doubts
        + `LIS(s) == LCS(s, sorted(s))` ?

* Longest Palindromic Subsequence
