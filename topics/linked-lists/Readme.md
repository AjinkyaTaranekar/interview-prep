# Linked Lists

* Singly

* Doubly

## Operations

* Insertion
    - `push_front()`
    - `push_back()`

* Deletion
    - `pop_front()`
    - `pop_back()`

* Load from `istream`

* Dump to `ostream`

## Algorithms / Questions

_All of these in seprate files that use the LL from header file._

* Reversal

* Intersection point of two linked lists
    - could have duplicated data
    - could have cycles

* Cycle detection
    - Floyd's Hare & Tortoise

    - Detect wheter a cycle exists
    - Find the length of the cycle (no. of nodes)
    - Remove the cycle (make the next pointer of the "last" node NULL)

## Doubts

* Why does the Floyd cycle detection algorithm works?

* Why does the two pointer approach to find intersection node work?
