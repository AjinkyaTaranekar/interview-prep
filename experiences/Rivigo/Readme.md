## HackerRank Test

* 2 Questions, 75 minutes

1. DP: Simple
    * Recurrence: `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3)`
    * The only catch was n could be till 1e9!

    * I coded it in a straightforward way, but 2 tests failed!

2. DP: Subsequence, reach X to Y with a string param `lrlrlr`
    * Couldn't even figure out what the problem was
    * Tried to see what others were doing and see if it made sense

## Mistakes 

* Don't try to look at what others are doing
    - Just wastes your time

* In DP questions, try to come up with a recursive approach first!

    - A function was already given with params
        + `string s, int n, int x, int y`

    - Could've tried a recursive solution that uses these params
