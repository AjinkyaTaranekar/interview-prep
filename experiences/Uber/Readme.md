## HackerRank Test

3 questions, 90 minutes.

[Screenshots of Questions](https://github.com/hthuwal/iitd-placements-experience/blob/master/Uber/coding-exam.pdf)

1. Custom Sorted Array
    * Had looked at a [similar question before](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-swaps-required-sort-array/)

    * So that is the approach I used - which turned out to be quite long
        - Made quite a few off-by-one errors
        - Wasn't even sure if this approach would work
        - But just started writing code!

    * Took me ~50 minutes to get all passing

    * Harish later told me that this question was much simpler :cry:

2. Uber Shuttle
    * Realised it was something similar to Travelling salesman problem
        - Couldn't figure out what the difference between TSP & MST is

    * Couldn't even figure out a bruteforce!

3. Uber Pool Game
    * Realised it was DP too late
    * Did started coding the right thing, but time up!

## Mistakes

* Wasn't really in the zone
    - Was still thinking about the AppDynamics test that happened just before

* Started Q3 too late
    - Could've gotten some cases correct

* Could've tried some sort of bruteforce in Q2
