## Coding Round

_On: Thursday 27 September 2018_

**Platform** : HackerEarth. C/C++/Java/Python (& others) were allowed.

**Duration** : 1 hour.

**Questions** : [Screenshots of the questions](https://github.com/hthuwal/iitd-placements-experience/blob/master/Cohesity/coding-exam.pdf)

1. _20 marks:_ From a string, find character with Kth largest frequency

2. _50 marks:_ Dynamic Programming: Maximum sub-array sum with non-adjacent numbers (& a small twist.)

**Experience** :

Both the questions felt easy to me. 

I started with the 1st (in Python), didn't read it properly, and just started coding - which came to bite me in the ass later and the problem ended up taking around 30 minutes of my time when it could've been solved in 15.

I did the 2nd one in around 20 minutes though, simply because I had done a similar question on HackerRank before. I got lucky and remembered the exact code so I didn't even have to think much here.

The biggest thing I took from the test was just how shitty HackerEarth's interface is - they had Ctrl + C / V disabled for god's sake. Idk, Who tf comes up with such brilliant ideas. 

**Learning** : 

* Think on paper first before you write a single LoC
    - Just come up with a high level pseudo-code
    - Hopefully, this would save time later

* Ought to do a few questions in Python
    - And that too - the Pythonic way!

* Ought to familiarise myself with various sites and their interfaces.
    - TODO: List what other platforms companies take tests on and try them all out.
