## Online Test

Platform: HackerRank
Questions: 3
Time: 90 Minutes

This happened in the Computer Services Center. 

**Q2**: 

Harish started doing this question, so I started with it as well. It just screamed DP - so I tried writing a recursive solution on paper - that I was later planning to memoize, but after ~5 minutes I looked up at Harish's screen and he had already started writing the bottom up solution.

Because, his code was clearly visible to me, I dropped whatever I was doing and started copying his code.

The rest of the test was just me trying to copy his code.

I couldn't understand a thing of what was written - what the `dp` array even denoted. I've never felt so blank in my life. Maybe I wasn't even trying to think, because copying was way easier.

After fixing some cases, Harish finally finished the question and moved to another one - but I hadn't copied the entire thing.

5 minutes later he told me that 3rd question was easy, so I switched to that.

**Q3**: 

This was a very simple greedy problem. I didn't know why I didn't have a look at it before. 

I began in C++, wrote a few lines, but realised that it would be hella easy in Python - so switched to that and wrote a 3 line python solution - which was accepted - all cases passing.

**Back to Q1**:

While trying to think about Q1, Harish left his 2nd question open for me to copy - and I did. After lots of peeping over, the question was finally complete and passed all cases.

**Q1**: 

I looked at the question and it was DP as well. I was trying to write a bruteforce when the time ended.
