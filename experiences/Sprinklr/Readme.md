## Online Test

Platform: HackerEarth
Questions: 45 MCQs and 4 programming
Time: 120 Minutes

This happened in the VI-LT2. 

**MCQs:** 

They were from all categories: OS, DBMS, Networks, Aptitude and a bit surprisingly - Linux proficiency (things like shebang, Last process' exit code `$?` etc.)

I attempted the first 20 MCQs with care, but when I realised that ~half an hour had passed, I switched to the programming questions.

**Q1**:

This was a very straighforward DFS. Did in Python. Passed all cases.

**Q2**:

This was straighforward as well. Escaping a maze via BFS. A few cases were failing for some reason.


**Q3**:


**Q4**:



## Mistakes

* Began coding in Python for some reason, perhaps it was because of Cohesity - that test too happened in VI-LT2, on HackerEarth, and I used Python to solve both questions.

* BFS should've worked!
