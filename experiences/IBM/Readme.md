The test was supposed to start at 9 PM, but actually started ~2 hours late - because of their shitty email & link system. What was supposed to be from 9-12 ended up being 9pm-2am.

## IPAT

The first was a mental ability test. 

Had two sections of 45 minutes each having ~18 questions of ~2 minutes each:

1. Number Series
    * Predict next number in a series  

2. Math Reasoning
    * Compund Interest, Ratio and Proportions, Percentages, Equations in two variables. Sets etc..

Section 2 turned out to be pretty hard for me, mostly because I'm damn slow, by the time I used to make equations etc. time would get over.

Use of a calculator was allowed - I used `speedcrunch`. One could easily setup speedcrunch formulae to make things a bit easier.

## Written Test

Questions were way beyond my level. [Actual Questions](https://github.com/hthuwal/iitd-placements-experience/blob/master/IBM%20Research%20Labs/Readme.md#round-2-offline-exam-60-minutes)

* Mathematical Proofs
* Dynamic Programming 
* Machine Learning

Couldn't really answer any question well.

## Mistakes

* Had zero idea of what would happen in the test
    - Could've easily looked up IPAT beforehand & practised for it
