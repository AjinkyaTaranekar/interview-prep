## Mistakes

* Made an input reading mistake in question 1
    - Took only the first & last digit of the input range
    - Code was running fine for sample test cases
    - but not for the actual cases
    - Even tried bruteforce - that didn't work either ofc
    - Couldn't figure out why it wasn't working

* Spent all my time on a single question
    - In the hopes of atleast finishing one question

    - I did try to read the other questions but didn't try too hard
        + Felt as if they were harder

* Didn't try out bruteforce in the last question
